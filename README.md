## Artifact Description

EvoSpex is a tool based on a genetic algorithm for learning postcondition assertions of Java methods. A postcondition assertion for a Java method is an expression that captures properties of the method's executions. 

Given a Java method, to produce its postcondition EvoSpex recieves as input sets of valid and invalid pre/post state pairs (i.e., state pairs that represent, and do not represent, the method’s current behavior, respectively). Valid pre/post state pairs are obtained by generating executions of the method under analysis, while invalid ones are obtained by mutating the valid pairs. Given these inputs, EvoSpex uses a genetic algorithm to explore the state space of candidate postconditions with the goal of obtaining one that is satisfied by the valid pre/post pairs, while leaving out the invalid ones.

## Reproducing the experiments in the paper

In order to reproduce the experiments in the paper, you must first follow the instructions described in [INSTALL.MD](INSTALL.md), to be able to run EvoSpex and its dependencies.

The paper contains two sets of experiments. In the first set, the tool is used to generate postconditions, whose quality is compared against those generated by the Daikon tool. In the second set, the tool is used on a number of contract-equipped classes, and the produced assertions are contrasted with the contracts, to assess how many of these can be reproduced by EvoSpex.

### Postcondition generation and comparison with Daikon

In this set of experiments, we generate postconditions both with EvoSpex and Daikon, and compare their quality using OASIs. The subjects are projects taken from the SF110 benchmark. Assuming that the target project has been compiled as described in [INSTALL.MD](INSTALL.md), we first generate the postconditions with the two techniques, as follows.  

**NOTE**: the instructions in this section assumes that the project being analyzed is *2_a4j*. The classes and methods to analyze for project *2_a4j* are listed in file *$EVOSPEX/src/test/resources/sf110/2_a4j/target-classes.txt*. To analyze other projects, just use any of the names listed when doing `ls $EVOSPEX/src/test/resources/sf110`. Again, the classes and methods to analyze for a particular project are listed in the file *target-classes.txt* of the corresponding folder. 
 
**Generating postconditions with EvoSpex**

```
  cd $EVOSPEX
  ./experiments/sf110/run-evospex-project.sh 2_a4j 10
``` 

The script will run EvoSpex 10 times for each of the analyzed methods of the project *2_a4j*. Each execution will be stored in the folder *experiments/sf110/2_a4j/evospex-results*.

**Generating postconditions with Daikon**

```
  cd $EVOSPEX
  ./experiments/sf110/run-daikon-project.sh 2_a4j
```

This execution will run Daikon performing the three usual steps described in this [example](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#StackAr-example). As a result, postconditions for each of the target methods will be generated and saved in the folder *experiments/sf110/2_a4j/daikon-results*.

**Quality of the postconditions produced by each technique** 

First, the generated postconditions should be manually placed in the corresponding Java files that will later be the input for OASIs, following the steps described in this [file](extra/COLLECTING_INFERRED_POSTCONDITIONS.md). Since such steps maybe confusing, the Java files already contains the assertions for which the quality was analyzed in the paper, sou you can continue with the next instructions.
 
Now, to analyze the quality of the postconditions we need to provide four arguments:
* the current project
* the class to be analyzed
* the technique (EvoSpex or Daikon) from which the oracles were computed 
* the mode (FP for false positives - FN for false negatives)

So, for example, to detect False Positives in the oracles produced by EvoSpex on class FullProduct of project *2_a4j*, from the folder *$EVOSPEX* run:

```
  ./experiments/sf110/run-oasis-class.sh 2_a4j FullProduct EvoSpex FP
```

and for postconditions produced by Daikon:

```
  ./experiments/sf110/run-oasis-class.sh 2_a4j FullProduct Daikon FP
```

This scripts will try to find False Postivies for the postconditions learned by the corresponding technique. It is important to remark that the assertions in the files corresponding to each technique, namely *$SF110SRC/2_a4j/src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProductEvoSpex.java* and *$SF110SRC/2_a4j/src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProductDaikon.java*, were alreay filtered and do not contain false positives. To perform the analyses from scratch, you should perform the following steps:

1. Edit the file *$SF110SRC/2_a4j/src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProductEvoSpex.java* by including the removed false positives that are described as comments in each of the analyzed methods into the assert statement at the end of method. For instance, the assert statement of method *addAccessory(MiniProduct product)*

```
assert(
  old_thissimilarItems == this.similarItems &&
  ExpressionEvaluator.evaluateSetMembership(product,"this . accessories",this) &&
  this.details != null
);
```

2. Detect False Positives with command `./experiments/sf110/run-oasis-class.sh 2_a4j FullProduct EvoSpex FP`

3. If False Positives are detected, remove the assertion causing it and perform step 2 until no more False Positives are detected. If no False Positives are detected, continue to step 4. 

4. Detect False Negatives with command `./experiments/sf110/run-oasis-class.sh 2_a4j FullProduct EvoSpex FN`

**Note**: exactly the same process should be performed for the file FullProductDaikon, and for every class analyzed for prohect *2_a4j*. At this point, the analysis regarding the quality of the postconditions finishes.
