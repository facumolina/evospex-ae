## Artifact Description

EvoSpex is a tool based on a genetic algorithm for learning postcondition assertions of Java methods. A postcondition assertion is an expression that returns true for correct method executions, and false for incorrect ones. 

Given a Java method, to produce its postcondition EvoSpex recieves as input sets of valid and invalid pre/post state pairs (i.e., state pairs that represent, and do not represent, the method’s current behavior, respectively). Valid pre/post state pairs are obtained by generating executions of the method under analysis, while invalid ones are obtained by mutating the valid pairs. Given these inputs, EvoSpex uses a genetic algorithm to explore the state space of candidate postconditions with the goal of obtaining one that is satisfied by the valid pre/post pairs, while leaving out the invalid ones.

## Paper experiments

To perform the paper experiments and reproduce the evaluation results you must first follow the instructions described in the file [INSTALL.MD](INSTALL.md)

Then, you can perform the following steps to perform our experiments:

### Measuring the quality of the postconditions

This experiment measures the quality of the postconditions generated by EvoSpex and Daikon on a set of projects that were took from the SF110 benchmark. 

### Reproducing manually written contracts
