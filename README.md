## Artifact Description

EvoSpex is a tool based on a genetic algorithm for learning postcondition assertions of Java methods. A postcondition assertion is an expression that returns true for correct method executions, and false for incorrect ones. 

Given a Java method, to produce its postcondition EvoSpex recieves as input sets of valid and invalid pre/post state pairs (i.e., state pairs that represent, and do not represent, the method’s current behavior, respectively). Valid pre/post state pairs are obtained by generating executions of the method under analysis, while invalid ones are obtained by mutating the valid pairs. Given these inputs, EvoSpex uses a genetic algorithm to explore the state space of candidate postconditions with the goal of obtaining one that is satisfied by the valid pre/post pairs, while leaving out the invalid ones.

## Paper experiments

To perform the paper experiments and reproduce the evaluation results you must first follow the instructions described in the file [INSTALL.MD](INSTALL.md)

### Measuring the quality of the postconditions

This experiment measures the quality of the postconditions generated by EvoSpex and Daikon on a set of projects that were took from the SF110 benchmark. First, assuming that the target project has been compiled as described in [INSTALL.MD](INSTALL.md), the postconditions need to be generated. 

**NOTE**: the instructions in this section assumes that the project being analyzed is *2_a4j*. The classes and methods to analyze for project *2_a4j* are listed in file *$EVOSPEX/src/test/resources/sf110/2_a4j/target-classes.txt*. To analyze other projects, just use any of the names listed when doing `ls $EVOSPEX/src/test/resources/sf110`. Again, the classes and methods to analyze for a particular project are listed in the file *target-classes.txt* of the corresponding folder. 
 
**Generating postconditions with EvoSpex**

```
  cd $EVOSPEX
  ./experiments/sf110/run-evospex-project.sh 2_a4j 10
``` 

The script will run EvoSpex 10 times for each of the analyzed methods of the project *2_a4j*. Each execution will be stored in the folder *experiments/sf110/2_a4j/evospex-results*.

**Generating postconditions with Daikon**

```
  cd $EVOSPEX
  ./experiments/sf110/run-daikon-project.sh 2_a4j
```

This execution will run Daikon performing the three usual steps described in this [example](http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#StackAr-example). As a result, postconditions for each of the target methods will be generated and saved in the folder *experiments/sf110/2_a4j/daikon-results*.

**Quality of the postconditions produced by each technique** 

In order to analyze the quality of the postconditions produced by the techniques, the inferred assertions needs to be collected and manually placed in the corresponding Java files that will later be the input for OASIs. For instance, a class analyzed for project *2_a4j* is *net.kencochrane.a4j.beans.FullProduct*, and the classes of interest of such a case can be listed by doing `ls $SF110SRC/2_a4j/src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProduct*`:
```
src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProduct.java
src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProductDaikon.java
src/main/java/net/kencochrane/a4j/beans/FullProductEvoSpex.java
```

The class FullProduct is the one from which the postconditions were computed. And the two extra classes FullProductEvoSpex and FullProductDaikon are a copy of the original one, but containing the assertions learned by the corresponding tools. 

### Reproducing manually written contracts

This is experiment analyzes the reproduction of manually written contractos.
