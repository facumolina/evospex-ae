Badges we are applying for: **Reusable**, **Available**. 

We apply for the Available badge as our tool is available in a public repository, it requires dependencies that are also publicly available, and we make available all our source code and scripts to facilitate its usage. 

We apply for the Reusable badge as our tool's site includes detailed documentation on how to use the tool, in particular to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. These instructions can also be followed to use the tool on other examples and case studies, of similar characteristics of those used in the experiments.
